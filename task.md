## Let's generate Rust egui / OpenGL app:
  - It should build and work on both windows and linux.
  - create build.cmd и build.sh которые будут собирать проект.
  - use standard stuff. The less non-standard dependencies - the better.
  - Don't guess and do not assume, I need working code. Use context7 and web search when needed.
  - Stop and ask questions if you suddenly found that you're not sure about some serious stuff.
  - Do not make dumb or sabotaging decisions.
  - Do not take shortcuts by changing the original task, always keep the logic.
  - Do not make simplified versions and placeholders, we're developing production code.
  - Do not hardcode things, everything should be done the best way possible.
  - Use concise but reasonable function names. Use "get_files" instead of "get_directory_listing"
  - Use all modern practices and best standards


## What I want:
  - Main Window with menu, toolbar and status bar.
  - We will need an OpenGL display area.
  - Application should have CLI arguments parsing as well.
  - Use concise but useful and smart names for variables, functions and classes, modularity, reusability.
  - I need elegant and concise solution, simplicity and efficiency over complexity.


## System stuff:
  - Use powershell for commands. There's no "/c:/" on windows.

Give me a plan.
Ask me questions.
Use sub-agents and context7.
